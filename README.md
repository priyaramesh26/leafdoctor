## 🌐 Overview
Leaf Doctor is a machine learning-powered tool designed to aid farmers and gardeners in predicting diseases affecting their plants. Leveraging TensorFlow.js for client-side inference and a backend server for processing requests, the application offers a seamless and intuitive user experience for disease detection and management.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
The system architecture follows a client-server model, consisting of the following components:

- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface accessible via web browsers for users to interact with the application.
- **Client-Side:** Handles user interactions and image submissions, initiates HTTP requests to the server, and displays the results to the user.
- **Web Server:** Receives and processes incoming HTTP requests, communicates with backend services, and serves the web application to users.
- **Backend Services:** Processes user requests, interacts with the trained machine learning model for inference, and sends responses back to the web server.
- **Trained Model:** Performs inference on uploaded images to predict diseases, integrated within the backend services for disease classification.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of plants showing symptoms of disease through the web interface.
- **Real-Time Disease Prediction:** The application provides immediate predictions on diseases affecting the submitted plants, enabling timely intervention.
- **Efficient Processing:** Leveraging TensorFlow.js for client-side inference and backend services for model integration, the application ensures efficient processing and accurate disease prediction.

## 🖥️ Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
